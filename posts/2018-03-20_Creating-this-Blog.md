title: Creating this Blog
---

As you may or may not know, I'm running this whole site through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It's pretty awesome. It's pretty simple and I can run everything from a single Github Repository. And it's free too. A previous version of this site was run through a small combined CMS / Hosting platform called [Webhook](http://www.webhook.com/). It wasn't expensive, but it also wasn't free. 

While Webhook made it very easy to create a blog, it's a little more complicated with Github Pages. As it's just a repository full of HTML, CSS and Javascript files, I would have to create new pages for each individual blog post. Doable, but horribly boring and inefficient.  

As more and more people are using Github Pages for their own sites, there are more and more applications that are devoted to creating services for them. After searching around there were a number of apps that I could use to create blogs, including [JEKYLL](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) and [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/index.html). In the end though, I went for [CMS.js](https://cdmedia.github.io/cms.js/)

For each blog post now, all I have to do is drop my blog as a Markdown file in the right folder in my repository. That's it! Very simple, very easy. And hopefully, because it is so simple and easy, I'll keep updating my blog on a regular basis. For once.
